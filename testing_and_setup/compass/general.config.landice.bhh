#This file is the landice core's configuration file. It is specific to the landice
# core, and a specific machine. Each machine will configure this file
# differently, but it can be used to point on version of the testing
# infrastructure at a different version of the model.


# The namelists section describes required namelist templates that are used to
# generate specific namelist files. In the landice core, there is only a 'forward'
# mode template, which typically would point to the namelist.landice generated in
# default_inputs after a successful build of the model.

# mode template, which generally points to the streams.landice generated in
# default_inputs after a successful build of the model.
