! Notes for setting up domain size:
! (1) We want ymax - ymin = 60 km, where ymax and ymin are cell center coordinates.
!     Let dy be the spacing between cell centers in the y direction.
!     Then let ny = 60/dy + 4.  For example, dy = 8 km => ny = 10 + 4 = 14.
!     The reason for the addition of 4 is that 3 horizontal rows will later be culled, and we will ignore
!     the two half-rows where y < ymin or y > ymax.
! (2) To choose dc = the x distance between cell centers: Divide dy by sqrt(3)/2.
!     For example, dy = 8000 m ==>  dc = 8000 m / (sqrt(3)/2) = 9237.604307 m.
! (3) The cells should extend past x = 200 km.
!     Let nx = int(200/dc) + 3 where dc is in km.  The extra 10 km gives some leeway,
!     and the addition of 3 accounts for the culling of 4 vertical rows.
! (4) nVertLevels does not matter, since it will be redefined later.
! (5) can set nproc = 1, since the mesh will need culling later to remove periodicity.
   dc = 4000,
   nx = 56,
   ny = 22,
   nVertLevels = 1,
   nTracers = 1,
   nproc = 1
